## About myself
    
    I am a third year student at the Faculty of Information Technology. Over the past three years, I have only found the direction of front-end    development  interesting. That's why I signed up for the course. Before starting the course, I set several goals for myself. Namely: successfully    complete the    course, bring my English level to A2, or better yet B1, and also improve my discipline.
